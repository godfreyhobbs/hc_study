# hc_study

Hackathon team: Godfrey Hobbs and Anthony A.

## Intro

The hc_study repo is a demo Linnia Protocol based decentralized application using the following:

1. React
1. Webpack
1. NPM
1. Jest tests
1. Metamask
1. Ethereum smart contract

## Details

### Medical Study and Recruitment

This application uses Linnia to solve the following two problems:

1. Screen individual for a medical study.
2. Execute a questionnaire-based study.
3. Reward individuals with an honorarium.

This is a break through demo as it shows how the above can be completed with a high level of privacy and security.

### Create React App

This application was created with `create react app`.  This made setting up the following trivial:

1. React
1. Webpack
1. NPM
1. Jest tests

### Preconditions

The demo assumes the following:

1. All parties have identities on the blockchain
2. Folks have already upload Electronic Medical Records to the Linnia Protocol
3. Folks have an Ethereum powered browser or Metamask

### Ethereum Decentralized Application

This application uses Metamask and web3 to interact with the Ropsten testnet blockchain.

The Linnia Protocol Contracts, Users, and Data Records have previously been deployed to Ropsten.

This DApp is using dummy data and users provide by the Linnia team.  This made development fast.

### Demo application

This is NOT a real application and shortcuts were made.

The Linnia Protocol helps create applications fast.  The code was mostly created during a 24 hr hackathon.
The code has since had about eight hours of clean up.
